# The DEAL

---

## Basic Idea

---

 * check the publishing costs 
   * for Germany
   * in a reference year
   * with the big publishers

 * get the same publishing but Open Access
   * for Germany
   * in future 
   * with the big publishers

## As of 2020

 * DEALs were achieved with Springer and Wiley
   * Open Acces for most of their journals
   * on the base of the 2017 numbers

 * Elsevier still on stall

# What is good

---

 * *public funding, public research*
 * Open Access by default
 * in line with [Plan S](https://www.coalition-s.org/plan_s_principles/)
 * control on publication costs


# What is not 

---

 * it is APC based
   * *no money, no Open Access*

 * it is article based
   * more articles processed, more money

 * libraries are out of the game
   * one layer of quality control less

 * favours large publishers
   * rewards previous overpricing


# Alternatives

---

 * community based journals! Diamant OA
 * arxiv plus Elsevier journals?
 * other?
