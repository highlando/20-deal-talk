# The DEAL

---

## Basic Idea

---

 * check the publishing costs 
   * for Germany
   * in a reference year
   * with the big publishers

 * get the same publishing but Open Access
   * for Germany
   * in future 
   * with the big publishers (Elsevier, Springer, Wiley)

---

## As of 2020

 * DEALs were achieved with Springer and Wiley
   * Open Access for most of their journals
   * on the base of the 2017 numbers

 * Elsevier still on stall

## As of 2023

1. Elsevier is just signed

   * opt-in for institutions
   * publish OA with APCs
     * 2550/6450 Euro/article + 3-4% increase/year
   * read access to almost all journals

2. Wiley/Springer contracts expire


# What is good

---

 * *public funding, public research*
 * Open Access by default
 * in line with [Plan S](https://www.coalition-s.org/plan_s_principles/)
 * control on publication costs


# What is not 

---

## {data-background-image="pics/springer-asks-for-money.png"}

---

 * it is APC based
   * *no money, no Open Access*
   * more articles processed, more money
   * misguiding incentives for publishers

 * libraries are out of the game
   * one layer of quality control less

 * favours large publishers
   * rewards previous overpricing

 * no sustainable transition to OA 
   * journals remain *hybrid*

# Alternatives

---

 * community based journals! Diamant OA
 * arxiv other open publishing platforms
 * [*subscribe to open*](https://oa2020-de.org/en/blog/2019/05/27/S2O_OAtransformation_journals/)
 * other?
